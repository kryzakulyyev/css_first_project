      The global aviation industry says now is the time to begin planning “the
      mission of the century”: delivering a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine
      to billions of people in some of the most remote parts of the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      The International Air Transport Association said in a statement Thursday
      that shipping a single dose of the vaccine to 7.8 billion people will
      require the use of the equivalent of 8,000 Boeing 747 cargo aircraft.
    </p>

    <p>
      IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac said such an undertaking “will
      be the mission of the century for the global air cargo industry. But it
      won't happen without careful advance planning.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “We urge governments to take the lead in facilitating cooperation across
      the logistics chain so that the facilities, security arrangements and
      border processes are ready for the mammoth and complex task ahead,” de
      Juniac said.

      The multinational effort to develop and produce a safe and effective
      vaccine for COVID-19, which as now killed over 900,000 people around the
      world out of a total of 27.8 million cases, received a setback this week
      when British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca suspended its final
      global trials of its experimental vaccine after a volunteer participant
      became ill.
    </p>

    <p>
      The New York Times reported Wednesday that the volunteer, based in
      Britain, was diagnosed with transverse myelitis, an inflammatory syndrome
      that affects the spinal cord and is often sparked by viral infections. But
      The Times said it is unknown whether it is directly linked to the AZD1222
      vaccine.
    </p>

   <p>This is the second time AstraZeneca has paused large-scale testing of its
    experimental vaccine after a volunteer became ill after being inoculated.
    The scientific journal Nature says the trial was halted in July after
    another participant in Britain also developed symptoms of transverse
    myelitis. The individual was eventually diagnosed with an “unrelated
    neurological illness.” Many nations are experiencing a surge in the number
    of new COVID-19 infections, forcing them to order a new round of strict
    restrictions that were first imposed at the start of the outbreak. Anies
    Baswedan, the governor of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, said Wednesday
    the government had no choice but to “pull the emergency brake” on the easing
    of coronavirus restrictions with the city’s hospitals nearing full capacity
    as they see thousands of new coronavirus cases daily. Jakarta has nearly
    50,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 1,300 deaths, making up the bulk of
    Indonesia’s 207,203 total cases and 8,456 deaths.</p>
